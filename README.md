# heartbeat-from-BCG
Automated heartbeat detection from BCG signals using advanced machine learning techniques
## Definitions
**Ballistocardiogram (BCG):** BCG is a graphical representation of the mechanical movements of the body caused by cardiac activity.

It measures the recoil forces generated by the ejection of blood from the heart with each heartbeat. These movements can be detected by sensors placed on the body.

BCG has the advantage of the ability to assess the cardiac condition with unconstrained
or even an un-awareness of the patient.


**Electrocardiogram (ECG):** It measures and records the electrical activity of the heart.
The ECG waveform consists of different components, including P waves, QRS complex, and T waves. These components represent specific electrical events in the
heart's cardiac cycle.


## Data acquisition protocol
The protocol includes four levels of imposed breathing with a descending frequency rate, with the subject in a sitting position. All the levels feature twelve breaths at a constant breathing period.
* Level 1: the breathing duration is 4 seconds per breath
* Level 2: the breathing duration is 6 seconds per breath
* Level 3: the breathing duration is 8 seconds per breath
* Level 4: the breathing duration is 10 seconds per breath
  
Twenty-six people were engaged to participate in the protocol. Among them, fourteen were male, and twelve were female. The average age was 26.15 years (± 2.44), height 171.26 cm (± 8.06 cm), and weight 63.67Kg (± 9.82 Kg).
