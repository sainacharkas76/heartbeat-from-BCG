# Data acquisition protocol
The protocol includes four levels of imposed breathing with a descending frequency rate, with the subject in a sitting position. All the levels feature twelve breaths at a constant breathing period.
* Level 1: the breathing duration is 4 seconds per breath
* Level 2: the breathing duration is 6 seconds per breath
* Level 3: the breathing duration is 8 seconds per breath
* Level 4: the breathing duration is 10 seconds per breath
  
Twenty-six people were engaged to participate in the protocol. Among them, fourteen were male, and twelve were female. The average age was 26.15 years (± 2.44), height 171.26 cm (± 8.06 cm), and weight 63.67Kg (± 9.82 Kg).
